# Simple-Sudoku-Solver

Solves sudoku puzzle. Currently it can only handle about 30 empty squares. When more are empty, it tends to crash the browser. That's because the algorithm is rather primitive, and just chooses random numbers out of legal moves, and repeats until a solution is found. I'm working on it to be faster and not crash the browser.
